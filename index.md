Hi, I'm Jack Stevenson. As of 2023, I'm a graduate student in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology PhD program at UCSF in the [Shokat lab](https://shokatlab.ucsf.edu). I like clear protocols, robust procedures and reproducible data analysis.

This website is intended to make it easy to share resources that I find useful. Check out some of my favorite tools on my [Resources page]({{ site.url }}/resources).
