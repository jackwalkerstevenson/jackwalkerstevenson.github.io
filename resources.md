### Software
Here are some apps I use every day:
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), a flashcard app for memorizing facts with spaced repetition. See [my spaced repetition page]({{ site.url }}/spaced_repetition) for more information.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com), a powerful to-do list app with good natural-language input ("water my plants every 12 days starting May 8") and, gloriously, a global Mac hotkey to add a new task without switching to the app. Free unless you want to get notifications on your phone.
- [Workflowy](https://workflowy.con), a zoomable bulleted list for taking notes, planning projects, organizing thoughts, writing recipes, etc. Free with a limited number of bullets.
- [Magnet](https://https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/), a simple Mac utility for managing windows with keyboard shortcuts.

### Programming
My experience is mostly in R and Python. Here are some references that I've found particularly useful:
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), a great summary of modern R by one of its modern architects, Hadley Wickham.
- The entire [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org), an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.
- [The Truthful Art](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/p/the-truthful-art-book.html), a book about the fundamentals of data visualization by Alberto Cairo.
