### Tools
Here are some software tools that I use every day:
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com), a powerful to-do list app with good natural-language input ("water my plants every 12 days starting May 8") and, gloriously, a global Mac hotkey to add a new task without switching to the app. Free unless you want to get notifications on your phone.
- [Workflowy](https://workflowy.con), a zoomable bulleted list for taking notes, planning projects, organizing thoughts, writing recipes, etc. Free with a limited number of bullets.
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), a flashcard app for memorizing facts with spaced repetition. See [my Anki page]({{ site.url }}/anki) for more information.
- [Magnet](https://https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/), a simple Mac utility for managing windows with keyboard shortcuts.
